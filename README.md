1. Dinos can be deleted from the kennel and the hospital.
1. Dinos can be added to the kennel, and the user's entry data gets validated to confirm it includes the dino's name.
1. Dinos can be fed, which improves their health score.
1. Dinos can be petted by moving the emouse over their picture, which improves their health score.
